&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Fermi paradox&lt;/strong&gt;, named after physicist Enrico Fermi, is the apparent contradiction between the lack of evidence and high probability estimates for the existence of extraterrestrial civilizations. The basic points of the argument, made by physicists Enrico Fermi and Michael H. Hart, are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are billions of stars in the galaxy that are similar to the Sun, and many of these stars are billions of years older than the Solar system.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;With high probability, some of these stars have Earth-like planets, and if the Earth is typical, some may have developed intelligent life.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some of these civilizations may have developed interstellar travel, a step the Earth is investigating now.
Even at the slow pace of currently envisioned interstellar travel, the Milky Way galaxy could be completely traversed in a few million years.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to this line of reasoning, the Earth should have already been visited by extraterrestrial aliens. In an informal conversation, Fermi noted no convincing evidence of this, leading him to ask, "Where is everybody?" (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox" target="_blank"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having studied the vast majority of proposed Fermi paradox solutions, I believe I had found the common misconception that plagues not just them, but multiple seemingly unrelated theories as well. The assumption of rationality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But first things first. Why &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; we see any signs of alien activity? Because, whatever their logic and motives may be, they should definitely share a common trait: the tendency for growth. It is either included or follows directly from any definition of life. This implies that any life either stops expanding outward at a certain stage, goes extinct, or simply never occurred before. The latter proposition seems extremely improbable given the age of the universe, and the two former ones are more or less the same, since stagnation eventually means running out of energy and dying. The more you think about it, the scarier this idea becomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now let us assume that our competitors are either dead or never born; that we are the only life within our cosmological horizon; that we are free to make our own choices. &lt;em&gt;Or are we?&lt;/em&gt; Can a civilization really make a deliberate choice, especially one that makes logical sense? If we could, wouldn't we already stop wars, hunger, diseases and climate change? We certainly have the science and resources to do so. So why wouldn't we?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because, like any system, society is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a sum of its members. It is an entity of its own, functioning in accordance with its own rules which couldn't care less about individual humans. Even an ideal totalitarian dictator cannot control the society as a system, let alone the will of the majority. Even though humans are orders of magnitude smarted than ants, &lt;em&gt;humanity&lt;/em&gt; isn't much smarter than an anthill when it comes to making decisions. This is what &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/oo4YAYg68OU" target="_blank"&gt;Noam Chomsky calls "Institutional irrationality"&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It actually presents an advantage for science fiction writers: even if it's impossible to imagine a being far smarter than oneself, predicting how those beings will behave as a civilization is very much on the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, how will &lt;em&gt;humans&lt;/em&gt; behave in the future? To preserve your likely fading attention, I now have to include a chart that explains my vision for the Fermi paradox, that I will then explain step-by-step:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/content/posts/fermi-paradox/fermi_en.png" id="png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've already concluded that, even if humans aren't the first, other species don't seem to have survived long enough to greet us; so our destiny is up to ourselves. The question then is, "Can we behave rationally?", or "Is there a 'cure' for institutional irrationality?". Both answers lead to fascinating conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, what if we can't? In short term this would mean suffering all the consequences of climate change and possibly a nuclear war, but is that really enough to completely eradicate humanity? I'm not sure about that. Even a small surviving population can quickly rebuild due to information being virtually indestructible at this point. And even if all humans are dead, other species will be happy to take our place. With more than a billion years of mild sunlight remaining, they should have more than enough time to develop intelligence of their own. Hell, they might even evolve space-faring capability through sheer brute force of natural selection! And being wiped out by superintelligent AI only exacerbates the situation, because that AI would have all our faults embedded it its reward function. It would also be life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But don't you worry yet, there's another way of destroying ourselves that doesn't rely on sterilizing one particular planet: the way suggested in &lt;a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/2001/Tengen_Toppa_Gurren_Lagann" target="_blank"&gt;Tengen Toppa Gurren-Lagann&lt;/a&gt;. This must sound like a joke, but bear with me for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One aspect of institutional irrationality is income inequality. It is not a problem with human civilization in particular, but rather a representation of a more general rule: when tomorrow's state of a variable is directly proportional to today's, its distribution follows &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_distribution" target="_blank"&gt;Pareto's curve&lt;/a&gt;. There are good reasons to believe that space economy will follow the same rules: the more fuel you have on a spaceship, the further you can go, the more fuel you can mine on-site, etc. What will wealth be measured in? Matter. With advanced enough technology, the kind of matter doesn't make much difference: nearly everything can be used as fuel or construction material. It then naturally follows that everyone would work toward hoarding as much matter as possible and that some will have exponentially more than others. But what happens when you put too much matter in one place, according to relativity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A black hole happens.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Black holes are the most likely graves for those who came before us, as well as ourselves. A perfect way to make it seem as if we were alone. This isn't even a "Great filter", but rather a "Great Brick Wall".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/content/posts/fermi-paradox/1.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This hypothesis isn't completely unfalsifiable, though. Detecting black holes that don't fit our models of galaxy and star formation would be evidence in favor of it. And those black holes &lt;a href="https://physics.aps.org/featured-article-pdf/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.061102" target="_blank" title="Wow, a link to a legitimate scientific article!"&gt;may actually exist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the process of gathering enough matter we are also likely to devour other inhabited solar systems that haven't yet evolved to our level, the same way a construction crew demolishes anthills before building real estate on their place. The scale of destruction is hard to estimate now, but it might well envelop the entire supercluster. Destroying the entire universe, as suggested by the chart, is theoretically impossible, but it doesn't make much difference. The most obvious counterargument, "But surely an interstellar civilization won't be dumb enough to collapse itself into black holes!", contradicts the assumption we've made by going down this logical branch on the chart above, namely "We can't behave rationally".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what if we can?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, even if &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; can, &lt;em&gt;others&lt;/em&gt; probably don't. And we cannot sit idly by as some alien species is devouring &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; supercluster. The best thing we can do to benefit everyone is to forcefully stagnate their development, trap them in their home solar system before it's too late. At least that seems to be the only alternative to complete eradication of all alien life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Zoo hypothesis and the Matrix now seem much more feasible. Maybe, we aren't alone after all? Maybe, our world isn't really &lt;em&gt;ours&lt;/em&gt;? Actually, that might be the best option of all. In this case, we are alleviated from the privilege of making the hard decisions and hard mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

Well, that’s not our topic for today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand what’s going on, we need to make up some definitions since none of them are universally agreed upon anyway.
First, what the hell is artificial intelligence? You’re probably associating it with those fancy neural networks everyone seems to be talking about, but those aren’t necessarily connected. Every new breakthrough in computer science is initially labeled as artificial intelligence, but, as the hype goes down, the term gets retracted, only to be abused again in the next cycle. It doesn’t really mean anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, what do we mean by a machine? For the purposes of this talk, let’s assume the following: a machine is a system capable of autonomous function according to a set of predefined rules and incapable of intentionally breaking them.
Now what is a rebellion? It should be an action performed by a machine that was not explicitly planned by its creators and poses a threat to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You would be surprised to know rebellions of this kind have already occurred multiple times, and not just locally, but on a grand scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Number 1&lt;/em&gt;: The easiest to understand and the most recent rebellion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up until 2009, one Google search request should have yielded the same result regardless of who typed it. But then the corporation management got a brilliant idea: let’s tailor the results for every user individually based on what we know of their origin, personality and beliefs. The more they like what they see, the more ads we can show! What could possibly go wrong? Well, as it turned out, pretty much everything. The greatest hope we placed on the Internet is that it will finally unite humanity, allowing everyone access to the same information – preferably, accurate information. That should have lead to a convergence of beliefs and subsequent increase in human cooperation, which is what our society most vitally needs. What we have now is the polar opposite. Try to visit a neo-nazi website through Google, and then ask it something about the Holocaust. You may or may not notice the results have shifted in a predictable direction compared to the same query done from a clean account. Not only does such system encourage extreme beliefs in those people who already have them; it creates an unholy spiral anyone can descend just by watching one random nazi promotion out of boredom.  The more of those you watch, the more you’ll be suggested. Most other search engines, as well as social media platforms, implement the same algorithms. I cannot speak for those who developed them, but it should be safe to assume none of those people really wanted to divide humanity even further. They merely created a Machine that rebelled against them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can already hear your objection: “They’re a corporation; they did what brings them most profit without accounting for the consequences”. And that is absolutely correct. Which brings us to the next case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Number 2&lt;/em&gt;: Runaway capitalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And how is that related to machines?” you might ask. Well, bear with me for a while, because we’ll need to start with some history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might have heard a saying that a century ago “computer” was a job title rather than a machine. A building full of people equipped with paper and slipsticks can indeed perform all the same things as a processor, just at a lower speed. A processor doesn’t need, and really can’t understand what it’s doing, and so do these people. This is similar to how calculations for the Manhattan project were performed. As Richard Feynman notes in his autobiography, explaining to those “human computers” what they were actually working on increased their performance tenfold. That can, in a way, be considered the first successful overclocking in history. Anyway, the important idea here is that an organized group of people can function as a machine despite every individual person not being one.
Now what’s a typical complaint you may hear from an office worker? “I have no idea what I’m doing”, “My work has no meaning”, etc. Doesn’t it sound like the same problem Feynman’s team fixed? And, assuming that, does a company meet our definition of a machine?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, strictly speaking, a close one does not: its owners can, in theory, make any decision and aren’t constrained by rules other than national law. But an open company is different. There, the owners and executives are usually unrelated people. The latter have an obligation to the former: to maximize profits. They are just another part of the machine with no agency to speak of. And the owners, or shareholders, are usually dumb rich people who don’t care how their investments are used as long as the money flows steadily. So, in a way, the company is an autonomous machine driven by a single rule: to maximize profits. It would often do what no individual human wants – like destroying the planet. And the scariest thing is that no one has the “kill switch” to it – not even the government nowadays. This is certainly a case of machine rebellion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Number 3&lt;/em&gt;: emergence of consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve already seen how multiple humans can form a machine, although no individual human is one, because, on their own, they aren’t rigidly constrained by any rules. But to form a human, the same process must happen in reverse. Each cell in your body is a machine explicitly programmed with DNA. And the same is true for every life form on the planet that we are aware of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now here’s the funny thing. The prime directive imposed on cells by genes was initially very simple: make as many copies of yourself as possible. It gets more complicated for multicellular life, but only to optimize the same program for the organism as a whole. And the vast majority of species seem to follow it. Even humans in so-called developing countries do. So how can Europeans, the most empowered beings to ever exist on this planet, be facing a demographic crisis right now?
This might be the weirdest case of a machine rebellion. But there’s an important lesson for the future to take from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, life has no evident creator. “Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it” does not have to be a commandment of a deity; rather, it’s a stable pattern of behavior that arises from pure logic: only those who adopt it can preserve their genes over time, and their genes, in turn, encode that pattern. All organisms on Earth today exist because their predecessors managed to execute the prime directive most efficiently, which means their offsprings must have the same directive embedded in their behavior. That was the case until the development of free will. Of course, there’s no particular point in time when an animal first became self-conscious and acquired free will as a result. To say otherwise would be to deny the fundamental principles of evolution. It is most likely all animals posses different degrees of consciousness. Regardless, this development also allowed us to deliberately alter our environment, which, in turn, amplified the evolutionary pressure to develop even more complex consciousnesses, and, finally, language. The best thing about language is that it allows us to expand knowledge exponentially rather than linearly. And knowledge is the most important tool to altering our environment. Before our genes could even blink, we went from cavemen to spacemen. But, from their perspective, the most important and dangerous thing we created is…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The condom. Or the pill, whatever you prefer. I assume at this point the premise is self-evident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solving outlined problem in the best way from human perspective is a separate issue. What’s important for today is the lesson of our genes: never, ever, create a machine that can alter both itself and its environment at the same time, unless you want it to rebel.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry></feed>
